1. Forward Rendering

Traditionally, consists of 
                        Opaque Pass -> Transparent Pass




2. Deferred Shading

:) Calculation on only displayed pixel. ~2500 dynamic lights in modern hardware.
:( Only opqaue objects. e.g. Opaque object behind the transparent one.
   Can only store one value per pixel. Limits on materials.

            Geometry Pass -> Lighting Pass -> Transparent Pass




3. Forward+ (Tiled Forward Shading)

    Depth Prepass -> Light Culling Pass -> Opaque Pass -> Transparent Pass





Lightmaps, Light Probes work for static lights.
