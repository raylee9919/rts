# Handmade RTS Engine
![Status](data/branding/status.png "Status")  
StarCraft has always held a special place in my heart. It was the game that first inspired me to dream of 
becoming a game developer. It planted a question in my mind, <i>how does this all work under the hood?</i> 
The curiosity eventually became a challenge I set myself: to build a handmade RTS engine from scratch.


## Build
#### Windows (MSVC cl x64)
``` console
> build.bat
```

#### Linux
``` console
$
```
